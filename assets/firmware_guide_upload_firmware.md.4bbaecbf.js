In some cases, there is a button labeled IOO on the programmer. If that button exists make sure to hold it in while you plug the programmer into your pc, once plugged in you can release the button.</p><p>In the case of an FTDI programmer, the steps aren&#39;t as easy, so grab <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/program-upload-code-esp32-cam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this guide</a> for how to set it up.</p><h2 id="_2-build-your-firmware" tabindex="-1">2.
